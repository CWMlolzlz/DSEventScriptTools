"Estus Quest" Dark Souls Event Script Mod

This mod adds a questline where your Estus Flask is stolen by Kalameet. You are also inflicted with the Calamity Ring
debuff (2x damage taken) and Fire Keeper Souls are dissolved upon touch -- although Anastasia's Soul is treated
differently -- for increased difficulty. Defeating Kalameet restores your Estus Flask and frees you of the perpetual
Calamity effect.

Intructions:

No unpacking or repacking is required.

Make sure to make backups of any files that are being replaced.

If your files are DCX packed:

From the "DCX Version" directory:
* Copy the four .emevd.dcx files into the "event\" folder in the Dark Souls data directory.
* Copy menu.msgbnd.dcx into the "msg\ENGLISH\" folder in the Dark Souls data directory.

If your files are not DCX packed:

From the "Non-DCX Version" directory:
* Copy the four .emevd files into the "event\" folder in the Dark Souls data directory.
* Copy menu.msgbnd into the "msg\ENGLISH\" folder in the Dark Souls data directory.

Only one of the above is needed, depending on if your Dark Souls data files are DCX-compressed. When in doubt,
choose the option that would result in overwriting existing files over the one that would not, hence the importance
of making backups of the files.

Due to the scripting, quitting the game after you acquire the Estus Flask before you exit the Asylum may cause a softlock.
Avoid this if at all possible. This mod is not rigorously tested, but should function correctly under normal
gameplay excluding this restriction.

Known Issues:
* Mashing A (interact) when the "status text" shows up on the screen can cause future texts to not appear at all. This is only a 
  concern during the initial event in the Northern Undead Asylum. Press A (interact) *once* when the text shows up to dismiss it.
* Not pressing A (interact) to dismiss the "status text" can cause other such texts to be hidden behind it. Dismiss the text
  in a timely manner (~15s) when it appears to avoid this.
